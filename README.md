# Cuticular melanisation
Quantifies the darkness of insect cuticle

### Introduction
The insect cuticle provides both a mechanical and physiochemical barrier against pathogens. The darkness of the cuticle (determined by its level of melanisation and/or sclerotisation) is often positively correlated with the pathogenic resistance of the host. This script automates the quantification of cuticle darkness from previously captured images, calculating the mean brightness of a foreground object (in BGR and HSV colour space) as well as its length and width.
